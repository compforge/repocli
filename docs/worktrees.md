# Worktree retention

RepoKit owns local worktree maintenance. A checkout carries a branch; a branch may carry a PR.
Remote PRs and local branches do not require a checkout. Removing a checkout retains branch refs,
PR observations and shared validation history.

## Policy and ordering

Configuration lives in `<git-common-dir>/repokit.json`, shared by every checkout of one repository:

```json
{"worktree":{"max_count":10,"max_prepared":3,"outputs":[]}}
```

`0 <= max_prepared <= max_count`. Primary checkouts are excluded from both counts. Each run:

1. Removes eligible checkouts of verified **merged** PRs, even below the count limits.
2. Removes the oldest remaining linked checkouts until `max_count` is reached.
3. Recounts surviving prepared checkouts and releases their oldest environments until
   `max_prepared` is reached. This is an independent count, not a fixed number of removals.

Creation time is recorded by the Python and Go worktree creation APIs in the checkout's Git
administration directory (`repokit-created.json`, schema 1, `created_at` in Unix nanoseconds).
Missing creation times sort **before all recorded times**; equal/unknown times sort by path.
No commit timestamp or filesystem mtime is substituted. CLI overrides apply only to that run.

Only merged is terminal for cleanup. Closed unmerged PRs receive ordinary count retention.
Count retention is independent of PR state: it can remove an old clean open/no-PR checkout,
while preserving its branch. A failed merged verification skips that checkout for the round.

## Protection and environment ownership

The invoking checkout, primary checkout, detached checkouts, explicit Git worktree locks,
in-progress Git operations and ancestors of registered nested checkouts are protected.
Dirty/untracked files and unmanaged ignored files prevent checkout removal. Removal never
passes `--force`. PR-triggered removal reuses the existing observer's association verification
and requires the local HEAD to equal the PR source SHA, including squash merges. New commits
on a reused branch are therefore not erased merely because an earlier PR merged.

Environment release can leave dirty sources intact. It uses the existing Component/workspace
dependency inventory, accepts only ignored checkout-local directories with RepoKit dependency
receipts, and additionally accepts exact relative directories declared in `outputs`. Such output
declarations assert that their contents are regenerable; they must not contain tracked files,
symlinked installation roots or nested Git repositories. Unmanaged dependency environments count
toward the prepared limit but are retained. Shared package-manager caches are never removed.
Preparation and cleanup share a repository process lease; preparation waits within its deadline
and Python cleanup skips a busy repository. Go cleanup waits within its command deadline. Explicit Git worktree locks
are the interoperable way to pin an otherwise clean checkout during use by another process.
Arbitrary external editors/installers do not participate in RepoKit's lease.

Skipped/failed actions are reported individually. Protected resources can leave counts above
the limits; limits do not authorize force removal. Git operations and identity are checked again
at the mutation boundary. Partial environment deletion is reported and can be retried.

## Entrypoints

The native Python operation is `repokit.worktrees.clean_worktrees`. `PullRequestContext.refresh()`
owns observation plus maintenance; its `ensure_pull_request`, `update`, `merge` and `close` methods
invoke that lifecycle after success. Maintenance errors are logged and available in
`last_lifecycle`, without changing the successful remote operation's result. There is no
`after_success` callback. Raw Forge clients, `get_branch`, `local_branches` and other ordinary
queries do not invoke filesystem maintenance.

The Go implementation lives in `toolkit/go/worktree`; the CLI directly calls this package.
Python provides a toolkit only: the `repokit-worktree` console entry point has been removed.
The former root-package Go worktree exports have moved to `github.com/compforge/repokit/toolkit/go/worktree`.

```sh
repocli worktree clean --repo /path/to/repository --dry-run --json
repocli worktree clean --repo /path/to/repository --max-count 10 --max-prepared 3
```

PR operations use the native `toolkit/go/forge` client. Both PR operations and cleanup query that
same capability, verifying the source repository, branch and exact head. Go currently queries
platform APIs directly; it does not read or overwrite Python/TypeScript observation caches.
Credentials come from `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GITLAB_TOKEN`; `--provider`, `--api-host`
and repeatable `--target-repository owner/repo` supply explicit connection/target scope.
No fork parent or another application's credential configuration is inferred. Without credentials,
count retention still works and PR observation is reported unavailable. `--dry-run` projects both
stages without deleting resources. JSON reports expose actions, errors and projected/actual
remaining counts. Errors return nonzero.

Both implementations keep `repokit-releases.json` in the checkout's Git administration directory.
Each pending relative directory is bound to its device/inode identity before deletion. This
ownership evidence survives removal of the dependency receipt and allows a later clean to resume;
a replacement directory is retained with an error. Python preparation refuses a pending release.
Go cancels Git process groups and waits for the Git process before releasing the repository lease;
in-process environment removal checks cancellation between entries and preserves the journal.

Deletion journals are stored outside disposable environments. A normal cleanup retires records
whose directory is already absent, completing an interrupted deletion before later preparation.
Dry-run only observes these records. A different directory identity at the same path remains
protected; recovery never authorizes deleting a replacement directory.
